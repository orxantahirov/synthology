            Dedicated to the lively streets of Baku and the charming Caspian
            Sea, SYNTHOLOGY reflects the essence of a brave generation.
          </p>
          <p>
            SYNTHOLOGY is an expression that fully embraces the light and dark
            sides of our being, the voice of our multifaceted nature.

            In the painting, the cloud symbol serves as an artistic expression
            of timelessness, representing one of the few elements of nature that
            remains constant even in our era of rapid change.
          </p>
          <p>
            The artist, through the universal and unchanging appearance of the
            cloud offers viewers a moment of pause amidst the speed and
            perpetual change of modern life, thus allowing recognizing and
            appreciating the stable and immutable aspects of nature and the
            universe.
          </p>
          <p class="mb_20">
            The cloud symbol is both a salute to the memories of the past and an
            invitation to the hopes of the future.
